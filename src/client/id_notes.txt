Players:
    Client -> client_id

    Chunk_server -> chunk_server_id

    Single Coordinator



                                             File
                                            file_id
{chunk_1, chunk_id, chunk_data}   {chunk_2, chunk_id, chunk_data}   {chunk_n, chunk_id, chunk_data}  




What does the coord need to know about a file/chunk
    - What chunkservers have which chunks
    - What chunks make up what file

    If a client requests to download a file, it needs to tell the client the location of all the chunks in that file
    If a chunk server goes down, it need to replicate every chunk that was on that chunk server



1) {chunk_1} -> chunk_server_a 

2) chunk_server_a stores chunk_1 

3) chunk_server_a tells the coordinator that it just stored chunk_1 which is the kth chunk in file x

4)
